## Tips & Best Practices

2. **Maintain Hierarchy:** Make important elements larger and bolder
3. **Use White Space:** Don't overcrowd your design
4. **Brand Consistency:** Stick to your brand colors and fonts

### Compliance Tips
1. **Check Early:** Run compliance checks throughout design process
2. **Safe Zones:** Keep critical elements away from edges
3. **Logo Size:** Ensure logos meet minimum size requirements
4. **Text Readability:** Use high contrast for text on backgrounds

### Workflow Tips
1. **Auto-Save:** Your work is automatically saved every 30 seconds
